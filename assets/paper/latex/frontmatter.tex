This thesis seeks answers to what happens with an information when someone contributes to sharing it on a Twitter network composed of Croatian users. It describes methods involved in planning and developing a Twitter \gls{data-platform} and introduces a data analysis with the goal of quantifying the way information is spread on the network. The network is analysed by applying different visualisation techniques and data structures to gain insights about the users in this network, the relationships between them, the information they share and the relationships between the information shared.
